        <h3> Summary </h3>
        <p> 
            In this visualization analysis, we explore GPA as a measure of student academic performance and examine how it relates
            to various factors such as parental education, study habits, tutoring, attendance, and extracurricular participation. 
            We found that attendance had the largest effect on GPA, followed by tutoring.

            It is important to note that this dataset represents a single snapshot in time and may not capture all possible influences 
            on academic performance, such as school quality or mental health. Additionally, the relationships observed are correlational 
            and do not imply causation. Further research, especially incorporating qualitative data, could provide deeper insights.
