            <h2> GPA Distribution </h2>
            <p>
                To begin we started with a  histogram displaying the distribution of GPA to get an overview of academic 
                performance among the students in the dataset. The distribution appears to be mainly normal, and most 
                students have GPAs centered between 1.5 and 3.0, with fewer students at the very low or very high ends 
                of the spectrum. This bell-shaped curve suggests that the dataset represents a typical academic population, 
                where a majority of students perform around the average, and extreme outcomes are relatively rare. 
                Understanding that this dataset represents a well rounded range of the population helps us to make overall 
                conclusions about the data.

            <h2> Study Time vs. GPA </h2>
            <div class = 'container'>
                <div class = 'image'>

                    <p>
                        This scatter plot examines the relationship between students' weekly study time and their GPA, 
                        with tutoring status represented through color (blue representing having been tutored).
                        Overall, the data reveals a very weak linear relationship between study time and GPA. Students across all 
                        study time levels display a wide range of GPAs, from low to high, suggesting that simply studying 
                        more hours does not necessarily predict stronger academic performance.
                    </p>
                </div>            
            </div>

            <p>Additionally, while there appears to be a slight concentration of higher GPAs among students with tutoring (orange), the 
                overlap between tutored and non-tutored students remains visually substantial. This indicated 
                to us that while tutoring may play a role in performance, it is likely not the sole determining 
                factor.</p>

            <h2>Bar Chart: Average GPA by Parental Education</h2>
            <p>
                We next wanted to explore the average GPA of students based on their parents’ level of education, ranging 
                from no formal education to higher education. Surprisingly, the chart reveals minimal variation in GPA 
                across all education levels. Students whose parents completed college or higher education do not appear 
                to have significantly higher GPAs than those whose parents did not complete high school. In fact, students 
                with parents who only completed high school or some college show slightly higher GPAs on average. This 
                challenges common assumptions about the direct influence of parental education and suggests that other 
                variables may play a more important  role in academic performance.

            <h2>Sankey Diagram: Parental Education -> Tutoring -> Grade Class</h2>
            <p>
                Continuing our exploration of parental education level effect on GPA, this Sankey diagram traces the 
                pathway from parental education levels through tutoring status to students’ grade classifications, 
                offering a layered look at how background and support factors might influence academic outcomes. One 
                notable observation is that a large number of students from lower to mid-level parental education 
                groups  do not receive tutoring, and a substantial portion of those students end up in the lower grade 
                categories. In contrast, students who do receive tutoring are more evenly distributed across all grade 
                levels, with some representation in the higher performance bands. While the diagram doesn’t show a direct 
                cause-effect relationship, it highlights how tutoring is a strong support mechanism for students, potentially 
                improving outcomes regardless of parental education level.

            <h2> Correlation Heatmap </h2>
            <div class = 'container'>
                <div class = 'image'>
                    <iframe src="heatmap.html" width="600px" height="380px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                </div>
                <div class = 'text'>
                    <p>
                        This visualization, a correlation heatmap reveals the strength and direction of linear relationships between key 
                        continuous variables: Age, Study Time, Absences, and GPA. An important observation is the strong negative correlation 
                        between Absences and GPA (-0.91), indicating that students with more absences tend to have significantly lower GPAs.
                    </p>
                </div>            
            </div>
            <p>
                Not surprisingly, there is a weak positive correlation between Study Time and GPA (0.18), suggesting that studying more 
                may have a small positive impact on academic performance, something we observed in the earlier scatter plot. Age appears 
                to have no meaningful relationship with any of the other variables. Overall, the heatmap emphasizes that school attendance 
                is a more critical factor in GPA than either age or weekly study time alone.

            <h2>Parallel Coordinates Plot</h2>
            <p>
                Takeaway: The parallel coordinates plot visualizes how multiple continuous variables, Age, Study Time, Absences, and GPA, interact on an individual student level. A key pattern that emerges is the relationship between Absences and GPA: students with low absences (near 0) tend to have higher GPAs, while those with more absences cluster around lower GPA values. Study time shows some positive variation, with a number of students who study more hours per week trending toward higher GPA values. Age, however, appears to have little variation in GPA, consistent with earlier findings. This plot reinforces the idea that attendance is a major contributor to academic performance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Design Idea: A parallel coordinate plot was selected to display multi-dimensional relationships between continuous variables for each student. Each line represents a student, and the line’s path across each vertical axis shows their value for each variable. By coloring the lines based on GPA using a gradient, the visualization allows viewers to detect patterns across variables and see which traits are commonly associated with higher or lower academic performance. This design is especially useful for identifying complex interactions and trends that wouldn’t be visible in simple two-variable plots.
