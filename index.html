        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <section>
            <p> 
                Understanding student academic performance is essential for improving educational outcomes 
                and promoting long-term success. One of the most widely used indicators of academic achievement 
                is Grade Point Average (GPA), a numerical representation of a student's academic standing. GPA not 
                only influences college admissions and scholarship eligibility, but it also reflects a student’s 
                study habits, support systems, and access to educational resources. Monitoring and analyzing GPA 
                can provide valuable insights into how various factors such as parental involvement, study behaviors, 
                and participation in extracurricular activity contribute to student achievement. A low GPA may signal 
                challenges such as lack of support or engagement, while a high GPA often correlates with strong 
                academic habits and a supportive environment. 
            </p>

            <p> 
                Beyond individual outcomes, GPA trends can also reveal broader patterns within the education system, 
                including disparities linked to socioeconomic status or access to academic support. These patterns can 
                help educators and policymakers develop more effective strategies to address gaps in performance and 
                ensure all students have equal opportunity in the classroom. 
            </p>

                Overall we chose to have our project focus on exploring the dynamics behind student GPA using a variety of 
                visual tools. By examining the connections between academic performance and different personal, familial, 
                and behavioral factors, we aim to better understand what drives success in school and how it can be supported
                across diverse student populations.

            <h3>Introduction to the Data</h3>

            <p>
                Our analysis makes use of a single comprehensive dataset titled “students-performance.csv”, which contains 
                detailed information on 2,392 high school students. The dataset includes variables related to students’ 
                academic performance, personal demographics, study habits, parental involvement, and participation in 
                extracurricular activities. These features allow for a well-rounded exploration of the various factors 
                that may influence a student’s GPA. The dataset contains 2,392 rows and 15 features. A summary of the 
                variables is provided in the table below:
